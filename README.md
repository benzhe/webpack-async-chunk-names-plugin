# webpack-async-chunk-names-plugin

## DEPRECATED, YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED THIS ANYMORE

https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#import-

```
import(
  /* webpackChunkName: "my-chunk-name" */
  'module'
);
```

## Why?

Webpack 2 no longer let's you name your cunks generated by `System.import()` or `import()`. So you would get chunks
named `0.js` etc. This plugn attempts to guess the chunk name by parsing the requested filename.

If you need a more robust solution, PR are very welcome.

## Installation

As a devDependency!
```
npm i webpack-async-chunk-names-plugin -D
```
```
yarn add webpack-async-chunk-names-plugin -D
```

## Usage

```
const AsyncChunkNames = require('../index');

module.exports = {
    entry: __dirname + '/entry.js',
    output: {
        path: __dirname + '/output',
        filename: 'output.js',
        chunkFilename: '[name].js'
    },
    plugins: [
        new AsyncChunkNames()
    ]
};

```

Don't forget to set [output.chunkFilename](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-chunkfilename)!
